# capstone-project

Hi, my name is Hannah Song and I'm a student at DevMountain. This is app was for my foundations CAPSTONE project. The app is an interactive calendar that allows the user to add and delete an event. The app also allows the user to search any given month and year, as well as, navigate the previous and next months using buttons. The app uses HTML, Javascript, and CSS with Node.js and express as the server.
